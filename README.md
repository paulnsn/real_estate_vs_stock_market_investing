##Introduction

In the first half of 2024, which saw the significant increase in mortgage interest rates in the U.S; this made me curious whether it made more sense financially to:

1) Buy a single-family residence in the Bay Area, or
2) Continue renting an apartment in SF that is rent-controlled

To evaluate both options, I was interested in using publicly available data to identify what the average increase in property price was for single-family residences over a period of time, its associated annualized rate of return, and how that compares to the annualized rate of return for the U.S. stock market. I will be using the S&P 500 index as a comparison. 

##Data Sources

Before diving into this project, I sought after the following datasets:<br>

1) Housing prices (historical over 10-20 years). If possible, look for data that is segmented by: <br>
a) City / County / Zip code<br>
b) Building type<br>
c) Property price over historical period<br>
d) Avg market price (historical over 10-20 years):<br>
    - S&P 500
    - Dow Jones Index (DJI) 
    - NASDAQ<br>

2) Interest rates (historical over 10-20 years)<br>
3) Rental rates (historical over 10-20 years)<br>
4) Average occupancy rate (for owners renting) <br>
5) Home maintenance costs<br>
6) Assessed value & Property tax (historical over 10-20 years)<br>
7) HOA fees for condos (historical over 10-20 years)<br>

The items above would be helpful in determining the true cost of owning a home and how it would compare to renting a home.

The following data were used in developing the findings detailed below:<br>

1) Historical assessed property values for single-family residences in SF (Source: Data SF): https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Assessor-Historical-Secured-Property-Tax-Rolls/wv5m-vpq2/about_data<br>
2) Historical S&P 500 returns by year (Source: Google Finance)
